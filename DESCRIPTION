Title: Improved Versions of Base Functions
Version: 1.2.0
Authors@R:
    person(given = "Tobias",
           family = "Schmidt",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "tobias2.schmidt@ukr.de")
Description: Operators and functions provided by base R sometimes lack some
    features found in other programming languages, such as the abilitiy to
    concatenate strings using + or to repeat strings using *. This package aims
    at providing such functionality without breaking existing code, i.e., only
    statements, that would throw errors in pure base R are patched.
